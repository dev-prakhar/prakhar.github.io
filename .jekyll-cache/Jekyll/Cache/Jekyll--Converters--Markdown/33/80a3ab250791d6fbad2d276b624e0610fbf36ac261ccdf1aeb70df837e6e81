I""<p>Before you start judging me, just hear me out.</p>

<p>Recently I gave an interview and was rejected (Obviously!). I think I wasnâ€™t prepared enough.
But <em>should I really be preparing for an interview?</em></p>

<h3 id="lets-look-at-it-this-way">Letâ€™s look at it this way</h3>

<p>Do you prepare yourself everyday before you go to work? I donâ€™t.
Isnâ€™t interview just a way to know if a person can work in the organisation?</p>

<p>Sure, the intervierwer wants to know if a person can code if itâ€™s a technical position. By all means you should judge a personâ€™s technical skills. But asking the candidate to code such problems, which(in a very likely scenario) the person will never encounter as a real world problem.</p>

<p>There are many things that you do while working and <strong>printing the bottom view of binary search tree when it is rotated at an angle of 30 degrees</strong> isnâ€™t one of them.</p>

<p>I have met many professionals in my life that are wonderful, when given a Data Structure/Alogrithm question. But not very bright when it comes to actual development. And I have met many professionals who are not good in Data Structures and Algos but their development is flawless. This doesnâ€™t mean that every individual who is good at DS is not good at actual development and every individual who doesnâ€™t know DS is brilliant at developing things.</p>

<p>But thatâ€™s the whole point. This way doesnâ€™t tell you if youâ€™re going for the right candidate or if youâ€™re rejecting a wrong candidate.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-many-aspects-that-could-be-missed">There are many aspects that could be missed</h3>

<p>When Iâ€™m given a question in an interview, I want it to be something I know(Obviously!) or something that makes me learn new thing. In my opinion, I donâ€™t actually learn anything new with DS questions. If Iâ€™m not able to get it, Iâ€™ll just open geeksforgeeks and check it out and Iâ€™ll not learn anything new because this knowledge will only help me crack interviews.</p>

<p>What is a BST? -&gt; <strong>Very Important</strong> for any technical individual to know.
Bottom view of BST -&gt; I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s necessary.
Are you getting my point?</p>

<p>When we write code for solving such problems, we forget to check for these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the code readable? In actual development we never use the variables =&gt; a, b, i, j k, count etc.</li>
  <li>Is the code easily testable? We should never ship anything without writing tests for it</li>
  <li>Are we following the write principles, such as not repeating ourselves or not writing very tightly coupled code?</li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience, working code can be written by anyone but writing working, testable, maintainable, readable code is a much bigger challenge.</p>

<h3 id="the-kind-of-problems-i-actually-faced-while-working-in-an-organisation">The kind of problems I actually faced while working in an organisation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Geeee, the server is throwing 504s and not able to handle the load, how should we decrease the response time and increase the throughput?</li>
  <li>DB is taking a lot of time to fetch rows, is the table indexed properly, can we use the indexed columns to query the results?</li>
  <li>Mongo is querying itself again if the returned documents are more than a certain limit, how can we avoid that?</li>
</ul>

<p>and many more. None of which couldâ€™ve been easier for me to solve had I known DS &amp; Algos a little better.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Everything thatâ€™s written is my personal opinion. Donâ€™t want to offend anybody :-P</p>
